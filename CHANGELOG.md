# Changelog

## v1.2.1

* Fix invalid typespec that was causing compiler warnings on Elixir 1.8. (Thanks [asummers](https://github.com/asummers), [pull/34](https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags/pull/34))

## v1.2.0

* Redis persistence: upgrade to Redix 0.9, which deprecates Redix.PubSub. The pubsub capabilities are now part of the base Redix package. This means that FunWithFlags also needs to drop the dependency on Redix.PubSub.
* Compatibility updates in the tests for Elixir 1.8.

There is no other change in this release, but this is a minor version bump because upgrading Redix and dropping Redix.PubSub will require applications to also update their dependencies.

## v1.1.0

* Drop support for Elixir 1.5. Elixir >= 1.6 is now required.
* Drop support for OTP 19. OTP >= 20 is now required.
* Update to Ecto 3 with the `ecto_sql` package.
* Update to Redix 0.8 and Redix.PubSub 0.5.
* Ecto persistence: add `NOT NULL` constraints to the table definition in the Ecto migration. This is not a breaking change: the constraints have been added because those values are never null anyway. If users of the library want to add them, they can do so by adding [this migration](https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags/blob/master/priv/ecto_repo/migrations/00000000000001_ensure_columns_are_not_null.exs) to their projects.
* Redis persistence: allow to configure the Redis URL with a system tuple to read it from an environment variable. (Thanks [seangeo](https://github.com/seangeo), [pull/29](https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags/pull/29))

## v1.0.0

This release introduces the last two gates that were initially planned and marks a milestone for the project. The API is now stable, and the project can graduate to `1.0.0`.

This release doesn't introduce any breaking change, however, and users of the library should be able to upgrade without problems. If you're also using [`FunWithFlags.UI`](https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags_ui) then make sure to also upgrade that to version `0.4.0`, which adds GUI support for the new features.

New Gates:

* Percentage of time gate
* Percentage of actors gate


## v0.11.0

* Add ability to clear the boolean gate only (useful for debugging).
* Added `FunWithFlags.get_flag/1`, to retrieve a flag struct. Useful for debugging.
* Internal improvements.

## v0.10.1

Improvements:

* Ecto persistence: explicitly set the table primary key as an integer type. This improves the compatibility with Ecto repos where primary keys default to a binary type, e.g. UUID. (Thanks [coryodaniel](https://github.com/coryodaniel), [pull/23](https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags/pull/23))

## v0.10.0

Possibly Breaking Changes:

* Allow binaries _and_ atoms as group gate names. Binaries are now preferred (atom group names are internally converted, stored and retrieved as binaries) and atoms are still allowed for retro-compatibility.  
While calling `FunWithFlags.enable(:foo, for_group: :bar)` is still allowed and continues to work as before, this change will impact implementations of the `FunWithFlags.Group` protocol that assume
that the group name is passed as an atom.  
To safely upgrade, these implementations should be changed to work with the group names passed as a binary instead. See the [update to the protocol implementation used in the tests](https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags/pull/13/files#diff-8c1bcfc3d51e8d863953ac5b57f0da2b) for an example.

Other changes:

* Compatibility updates for Ecto 2.2 (dev env, was fine in prod)

## v0.9.2

Bug Fixes:

* Fixed another issue with modules referencing Ecto.

## v0.9.1

Bug Fixes:

* Fixed an issue with module referencing Ecto that was not wrapped in a `Code.ensure_loaded?` block, which prevented the library from being used in projects that did not include Ecto.

## v0.9.0

* Ecto persistence adapter. It's now possible to store flag data with Ecto instead of Redis; if used in conjunction with the Phoenix.PubSub adapter, it's possible to use this library in Phoenix without Redis.
* The `redix` dependencency is now optional.
* Added optional `ecto` dependency.

## v0.8.1

* Mark the `redix_pubsub` dependency as optional.
* Clearer error reporting for missing adapter dependencies.

## v0.8.0

New Features:

* Added support for Phoenix.PubSub as an alternative transport for the cache busting notifications.
* Added ability to enable the ETS cache but disable the cache-busting notifications, as it can be useful when running on a single node.

Other changes:

* Upgraded `redix` and `redix_pubsub` dependencies.
* Internal project and supervision changes to better support different adapters.
* Updated the Mix configuration options.
* More rational test setup.

## v0.7.1

Bug fixes:

* Resolved an issue with the PubSub connection process that would crash the entire supervision tree in case of abrupt disconnection from Redis. Ops!

## v0.7.0

New Features:

* `FunWithFlags.all_flags/0` is now public and documented.
* Added `FunWithFlags.all_flags_names/0`, public and documented.
* Added proper log statements via the Elixir `Logger`. Setting the log level to `debug` will print cache busting info, for example.

Internal changes:

* Updated the `redix` and `redix_pubsub` dependencies.
* Extracted the private persistence and notifications modules into a redis-specific namespace. Added a config option to customize the adapters on startup, and an internal API that allows to develop other adapters to use alternative persistence and notification layers. The persistence adapters are responsible for declaring their own notifications module (if any). The provided default ones keep using Redis, and they work in tandem. At the moment, no official support for other adapters is planned, `redix` stays as a dependency.


## v0.6.0

New features:

* Added `FunWithFlags.clear/2` to delete a specific gate or an entire flag. This is useful if you don't need an actor or group override and want to use the default boolean rule instead. Clearing a flag or a gate uses the same PubSub cache busting functionality used when updating a flag.
* Added `FunWithFlags.all_flags/0`, to return a list of all the flags stored in Redis. Undocumented because it's meant to build a GUI.

## v0.5.0

Added the `Group` protocol and group gates. It's now possible to enable or disable a flag for a group name and implement `Group` for types and structs that should belong to groups.

## v0.4.0

Added the `Actor` protocol and actor gates. It's now possible to implement `Actor` for some type or struct and then enable or disable a flag for some specific values.

## v0.3.0

Always raise exceptions if Redis becomes unavailable _and_ there is no cached value (expired or not). This means that both with or without cache, failures to load a flag's data will never be silently converted to the flag being disabled.

## v0.2.0

Significant internal rewrite: use structures instead of raw booleans. Given the scope of the changes and the fact that this is still a `0.x` release, bump the version number.

## v0.1.1

* Enhancements
    * Treat cache misses and expired cached values differently. If Redis becomes unavailable, and an expired value is available in the cache, use the expired value even though normally it would be discarded.


## v0.1.0

First usable release with the a stable initial feature set.

* Simple boolean flags
* Elixir API to enable, disable and query the flags
* Supervision tree, embeddable in host applications
* Persistence in Redis
* ETS cache
    * Cache busting with TTLs
    * Cache busting with Redis PubSub
* Resistant to Redis connection issues if the values are cached
* Option to disable the ETS cache (Redis-only mode)


## v0.0.x

Unstable releases.
